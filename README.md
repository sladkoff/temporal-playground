# temporal-playground

This repo was created for an internal Hackathon at Device Insight ("Ship it day").

The goal was to experiment with [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), learn about the concepts and see how it can be used in real-world scenarios.

## General notes about our experience with Temporal

- In general it was easy to get started with Temporal locally
- However, Nico has issues starting the Typescript examples due to incompatible architecture modules
  - Could be fixed by deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
